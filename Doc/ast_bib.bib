  abstract     = {Underwater sounds generated by Thunnus albacares and Thunnus thynnus
	were recorded and studied to explore the possibility of passive-acoustical
	detection. Possible tuna sounds were recorded at the Monterey Bay
	Aquarium, Monterey, California, and Maricultura del Norte in Ensensada,
	Baja California, Mexico. At both locations, the most prevalent sounds
	seemingly associated with tuna were low-frequency pulses varying
	from 20 to 130 Hz, lasting about 0.1 s, and usually single and apparently
	unanswered. A behavior similar to coughing was coincident with these
	sounds: the animal's mouth opened wide with its jaw bones extended
	and its abdomen expanded, then contracted abruptly. On one occasion
	in Mexico, this behavior and associated signal were simultaneously
	recorded. Because these measurements were made in noisy environments,
	this study should be repeated under more controlled conditions before
	tuna vocalizations can be claimed with certainty. Nevertheless, the
	center frequencies of these sounds appear to vary with respect to
	the resonant frequencies of the tuna's swim bladder, suggesting a
	passive-acoustical proxy for measuring the size of tuna. Matched
	filter and phase-difference techniques were explored as means for
	automating the detection and bearing-estimation processes. (C) 2003

  abstract  = {In January and February 2000, four ships conducted an extensive hydrographic
	survey of the Scotia Sea as part of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey. There
	were 169 CTD stations to at least 1000 m depth, making this the largest
	synoptic dataset since 1981. A hydrographic section at Drake Passage
	was used to define water masses and ocean fronts. In 2000, the Subantarctic
	Front and the Polar Front were unusually close, and the entire survey
	occurred to the south of the Polar Front. The survey area was bisected
	by the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current Front and the Southern Boundary
	of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In Drake Passage, these fronts
	were widely spaced. A further two hydrographic sections to the cast
	of Drake Passage show that the relative location of these fronts
	changes east of Drake Passage. Horizontal maps across the survey
	area show that close to Drake Passage, properties are aligned in
	a southwest to northeast direction. At approximately 35degreesW,
	properties become orientated in a north-south direction. A map of
	geopotential anomaly shows the flow field across the survey area
	and allows identification of oceanic fronts. In months previous to
	the survey, the giant icebergs A22B and B10A crossed the Scotia Sea
	and closely followed the geopotential field from the CCAMLR 2000
	dataset. The SACCF is not the only important front for transporting
	biological matter from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia;
	an interaction between the SBACC and the SACCF is also likely to
	be important. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Acoustic estimates of the densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia
	superba, in areas around South Georgia (SG) and Elephant Island (EI)
	were compared for seven austral summers between 1981 and 1997. Estimated
	densities of krill at SG were most often lower than at EI, although
	this may simply have been a function of differences in the survey
	and data-analysis techniques used at each site. More interestingly,
	the magnitudes of density and between-year gradients of density at
	each site were mirrored by those at the other location; for example
	1991 and 1994 were years of very low krill density at both SG and
	EI. There was no apparent lag in changes in density between sites,
	and ranked between-year gradients in density at both locations were
	closely correlated. These pronounced similarities suggest that densities
	of krill at both locations are linked directly, and may be impacted
	by the same gross physical and biological factors (e.g. recruitment,
	dispersal and environmental variability) acting over the same temporal
	and spatial scales. The observed concordance also implies that the
	pelagic ecosystems at these widely separated sites (similar or equal
	to 1500 km distant at opposite sides of the Scotia Sea) are not operating
	in isolation. Fluctuations in krill density were investigated with
	reference to cyclical variations in sea ice extent, and in air and
	sea-surface temperature. The resulting model suggests that the 1999/2000
	austral summer will be one of low krill density.},

	using target strengths appropriate for krill in the region: krill
	size was determined from diet samples from furseals and penguins

	was treated analogously to motion along-track of a research vessel
	through a nominally stationary body of water during a conventional

	krill abundance. This is ecologically instructive for South Georgia,
	where krill are generally passive drifters on currents and where
	temporal fluctuations in abundance have significant consequences
	for krill-dependent predators. Moorings were positioned on routine
	research vessel survey transects, and validity of the mooring method
	was assessed by comparison of mooring and vessel observations. Krill
	density estimates from the moorings were not statistically different
	from vessel estimates in adjacent time periods. A time series of
	krill density from a mooring revealed step-changes that were not
	seen during short-term vessel surveys. Moorings deliver data over

	requires that echoes, simultaneously detected with two or more adjacent
	split-beam transducers of different frequencies, pass multiple-target
	rejection algorithms at each frequency, and characterize virtually
	identical three-dimensional target coordinates. To translate the
	coordinates into a common reference system for comparison, the previous
	method only considered relative transducer positions and assumed
	that the beam axes of the transducers were parallel. The method was
	improved by first, optimizing the accuracy and precision of the range
	and angular measurements of the individual frequency detections;
	and second, precisely determining acoustically the relative positions
	and angular orientations of the transducers, thus completely describing
	the reference-system transformation(s). Algorithms are presented
	for accurately and precisely estimating the transformation parameters,
	and efficiently rejecting multiple targets while retaining measurements
	of most single targets. These improvements are demonstrated through
	simulations, controlled test-tank experiments, and shipboard measurements
	using 38- and 120-kHz split-beam transducers. The results indicate

	97% of multiple targets, while allowing 99% of the resolvable single

	(second-order moment) that allow the measurement of the scattering
	cross section, its variance (fourth-order moment) is shown to be
	mainly sensitive to the scatterer displacement. The robustness of
	DRAWS is discussed using different configurations: a computer simulation
	of a moving scatterer in a two-dimensional cavity. Experiments were
	also carried out with a 23-mm-diameter copper sphere moved by stepping
	motors in 16 liters of water, and finally a human walking in a 125-m(3)

	of harmless techniques for monitoring fish in a tank. Acoustic telemetry
	has been used to monitor fish swimming behavior, and passive acoustics
	have been used to monitor fish feeding, but new techniques are needed
	to monitor non-invasively their numbers and growth rates. Recently,
	it has been demonstrated that the acoustical total scattering cross
	section of fish swimming in a tank can be measured from multiple
	reverberation time series. These measurements have been used successfully
	to estimate the number of fish in a tank in laboratory conditions,

	a novel method for acoustically monitoring fish numerical density
	and behavior, and measuring their growth rates over long periods
	of time. These measurements can be performed remotely, without human
	interaction with the fish, and are harmless. To demonstrate the efficiency
	of these techniques, the number of sea bass, as well as the behaviors
	of sardines, rockfish and sea bass, in different tanks were monitored.
	Also, the growth rates of a group of starved sardines and a group
	of fed sardines were measured acoustically, over I month. For comparison,

	to understand their foraging behavior and ecology. We describe methods
	that combine concurrent dive recorder deployment, oceanographic sampling,
	and hydroacoustic surveys to generate hypotheses about interactions
	between the physical environment and the distribution, abundance,
	and behavior of pelagic predators and their prey. Our approach is
	to (1) map the distribution of whales in relation to the distribution
	of their prey and the physical features of the study area (bottom
	topography, temperature, and salinity); and (2) measure the foraging
	behavior and diet of instrumented whales in the context of the fine-scale
	distribution and composition of their prey and the physical environment.
	We use this approach to demonstrate a relationship between blue whale
	distribution, sea surface temperature, and concentrations of their
	euphausiid prey at different spatial scales offshore of the Channel
	Islands, California. Blue whale horizontal spatial distribution was
	correlated with regions of high acoustic backscatter. Blue whale
	dive depths closely tracked the depth distribution of krill. Net
	sampling and whale diet revealed that whales fed exclusively upon
	dense schools of Euphausia pacifica (between 100 and 200 m) and Thysanoessa
	spinifera (from the surface to 100 m). Whales concentrated foraging
	efforts upon those dense euphausiid schools that form downstream
	from an upwelling center in close proximity to regions of steep topographic
	relief We propose that (1) the distribution of Balaenoptera whales
	in the coastal California Current region is defined by their attraction
	to areas of predictably high prey density; (2) the preferred prey
	of these whales are several species of euphausiids (E. pacifica,
	T. spinifera, and N. simplex) that are abundant in the California
	Current region; (3) blue whales concentrate their foraging efforts
	on dense aggregations of euphausiids found at discrete depths in
	the water column; (4) these localized areas of high euphausiid densities
	are predictable and sustained by enhanced levels of primary productivity
	in regions which are located downstream from coastal upwelling centers
	(indicated by sea surface temperature); (5) topographic breaks in
	the continental shelf located downstream from these upwelling centers
	work in concert with euphausiid behavior to collect and maintain
	large concentrations of euphausiids swarms, and (6) despite seasonal
	and inter-annual variability, these processes are sufficiently consistent
	that the distribution of Balaenoptera whales can be predicted. (C)

	of acoustic-survey estimates by providing greater sampling volumes

	strength of fish can vary with its pitch, roll, and yaw. Here, normalized,
	acoustic backscatter patterns from fish schools are modelled by beam-incidence
	angle, 0-180 degrees, considering the scattering-directivity patterns
	of each fish. Variation of pitch angle causes a decrease in the mean
	and an increase in the variance of the backscatter in the vertical
	beam, but has no effect on the backscatter in the outer beams. Conversely,
	variation of the yaw causes a decrease in the mean and an increase
	in the variance of the backscatter in only the outer beams. Because
	the fish-scattering model predicts different backscatter at dorsal-

  abstract  = {Target strength (TS) estimation is a principal source of uncertainty
	in acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Although
	TS is strongly dependent on krill orientation, there is a paucity
	of information in this regard. This paper considers the potential
	for narrow-bandwidth, multibeam-echosounder (MBE) data to be used
	for estimating the orientations of krill beneath survey vessels.
	First, software was developed to predict MBE measurements of the
	directivity patterns of acoustic scattering from individual or aggregated
	krill in any orientation. Based on the distorted-wave, Born approximation
	model (DWBA), scattering intensities are predicted vs. MBE angles
	for specified distributions of krill orientations (pitch, roll, and
	yaw angles) and swarm densities. Results indicate that certain distributions
	of orientations, perhaps indicative of particular behaviour, should
	be apparent from the sonar data. The model results are compared with
	measurements on krill made using a 200-kHz MBE deployed from a small
	craft off Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica, in summer
	2006. The stochastic DWBA model is then invoked to explain disparities
	between the model predictions and MBE measurements.},

  abstract  = {Antarctic krill, Eaphausia superba, comprises the foundation of the
	foodweb in the Southern Ocean and is the target of a large fishery.
	Recently, the total abundance of krill in the Scotia Sea was estimated
	from an international echosounder and net survey (CCAMLR 2000) to
	be 44.3 million metric tonnes (Mt; CV 11.4%) (Hewitt et al., 2002).
	The new biomass estimate prompted the Antarctic Treaty's Commission
	for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
	to revise the precautionary catch level for krill in the area from
	1.5 to 4 Mt (SC-CAMLR, 2000). These survey results are based on the
	total echo energy attributed to krill, scaled by the Greene et al.
	(1991) model of krill acoustical reflectivity or target strength
	(TS). Presented here is a re-analysis of the CCAMLR 2000 data incorporating
	recent improvements in the characterization of krill TS. The results
	indicate that the estimated krill biomass in the Scotia Sea may be
	as high as 192.4 Mt (CV = 11.7%), or as low as 109.4 Mt (CV = 10.4%),
	depending solely on the expected distribution of krill orientations.
	The new Stochastic, Distorted-Wave, Born-Approximation (SDWBA) TS
	model solved with an empirically estimated distribution of in situ
	orientations leads to a krill-biomass estimate that is nearly 2.5
	times the previous estimate. In consequence, revisions may be warranted
	of the standard krill TS model, the CCAMLR 2000 biomass estimate,
	and the associated precautionary catch level for krill in the Scotia
	Sea. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International

	18 February to 9 March 2002, mean total target strengths (TTS 10
	log(sigma(t)/4pi)), were measured from groups of 57-1169 krill (average
	standard length 31.6 turn; standard deviation = 6.6 mm) at the Cape
	Shirreff field station, Livingston Island, Antarctica, and aboard

	(0.6degreesC less than or equal totemperatureless than or equal to

	tank and the modulated reverberations were sensed bi-statically with
	three omni-directional receivers. At each center frequency (f(c))
	the coherent energy in 200-pulse ensembles identified sound scattered

	from the krill, Thus, the TTS at each f(c) was extracted from a correlation
	analysis of energy reverberated in the tank. Measurement bias was
	determined to be +/-0.4 dB from an experiment using metal sphere

	(Deep Sea Res. 1145(7) (1998) 1273). Based on the distorted-wave

	of scattering from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder. It was
	empirically validated at 120 kHz near-broadside incidence (theta
	approximate to 90degrees), but large discrepancies were observed
	at other angles away from the main lobe. As the side-lobe measurements
	were both higher than the model predictions and above the noise floor,
	the authors noted that the differences were not entirely due to noise.
	In this study, the accuracy of the DWBA model is further explored.
	Results indicate that phase variability in the scatter from elements
	of a discretized-bent cylinder (krill model) causes a dramatic flattening
	in the side-lobe regions of TS(theta), while negligibly affecting
	the main scattering lobe. These results are consistent with the krill

	The efficacies of the amplitude-based techniques are challenged,

  abstract  = {The diel vertical migration (DVM) of Antarctic krill (Enphausia superba)
	can greatly bias the results of qualitative and quantitative hydroacoustic
	surveys which are conducted with a down-looking sonar and irrespective
	of the time of day. To demonstrate and quantify these negative biases
	on both the estimates of biomass distribution and abundance, a time-depth-density
	analysis was performed. Data were collected, as part of the United
	States Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR), in the vicinities
	of Elephant Island, Antarctica, during the austral summers of 1992
	and 1993. Five surveys were conducted in 1992; two covered a 105
	by 105 n.mi. area centered on Elephant Island, two encompassed a
	60 by 35 n.mi. area immediately to the north of the Island, and one
	covered a 1 n.mi.(2) area centered on a large krill swarm to the
	west of Seal Island. The 1993 data include repetitions of the two
	small-area and two large-area surveys. Average krill volume densities
	were calculated for each hour as well as for three daily periods:
	day, twilight and night. These data were normalized and presented
	as a probability of daily average density. With spectral analysis
	to identify the frequencies of migration, a four-term periodic function
	was fitted to the probability density function of average daily biomass
	versus local apparent time. This function was transformed to create
	a temporal compensation function (TCF) for upwardly adjusting acoustic
	biomass estimates. The TCF was then applied to the original 1992
	survey data; the resulting biomass estimates are an average of 49.5%
	higher than those calculated disregarding biases due to diel vertical
	migration. The effect of DVM on the estimates of krill distribution
	are illustrated by a comparison of compensated and uncompensated
	density maps of two 1992 surveys. Through this technique, high density
	krill areas are revealed where uncompensated maps indicated low densities.},

  abstract  = {Target strengths (TS) of various zooplankton were measured at 200
	kHz, 420 kHz, and 1 MHz and the dependence of these data on animal
	volume versus cross-sectional area was explored. The 420-kHz and
	1-MHz data were collected with a dual-beam sonar system and the 200-kHz
	data with a split-beam system. Experiments were conducted with live,
	tethered individuals in an enclosure filled with filtered seawater.
	The data were compared to both empirical and theoretical models of
	reduced target strength (TS normalized by the square of the animal
	length) versus ka (the product of wave number and equivalent cylindrical
	radius). The theoretical models chosen for this comparison were two
	versions of a high-pass bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1989b) that
	indicate TS is dependent on animal volume, and the ray bent-cylinder
	model (Stanton, 1993a) which implies TS is dependent on the cross-sectional
	area. The dependence of acoustic backscattering on animal volume
	or area was tested by fitting regression lines for TS versus the
	logs of ka, length (L), wet weight (WW), and dry weight (DW). Contrary
	to an empirical model derived from similar experiments (Wiebe et
	al., 1990), and to the high-pass models, the regressions indicated
	that TS is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the animal.
	However, because scattering from individual zooplankton is highly
	nonlinear, especially in the geometric scattering region (ka>1),
	linear regressions of TS versus the log of ka, L, WW, or DW can be
	misleading. Furthermore, neither Wiebe er al. (1990) nor this experiment
	directly accounted for animal orientations. Simulations using a distorted-wave
	Born-approximation model (Chu et al., 1993), indicated that animal
	behavior is an important factor in the scattering characteristics
	of zooplankton. Different distributions of animal tilt angle can
	influence the general trend of the TS model to exhibit either areal
	or near volumetric dependence. (C) 1995 Acoustical Society of America.},

	systems for fisheries surveys in one environment and apply the resulting

	may be different for estimates derived from each echosounder frequency.
	In moving to quantify and mitigate these effects, the performances
	have been measured for ten commonly used survey transducers in water
	temperatures ranging from similar to 1 degrees C to 18 degrees C,
	using three techniques. Results show that the transducer impedances
	all change with temperature, potentially changing the signal-to-noise
	ratio from 5 to >20 dB. The resonance frequencies and quality factors
	also change with temperature, ranging from similar to 0.2% to 2.8%

	in the echosounder gains, the transmitting-current and receiver-voltage
	responses changed 1 dB or less with temperature, except for the Simrad

  abstract = {During the last century, the population of Pacific sardine (Sardinops
	sagax) in the California Current Ecosystem has exhibited large fluctuations
	in abundance and migration behavior. From approximately 1900 to 1940,
	the abundance of sardine reached 3.6 million metric tons and the
	"northern stock" migrated from offshore of California in the spring
	to the coastal areas near Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island
	in the summer. In the 1940s, the sardine stock collapsed and the
	few remaining sardine schools concentrated in the coastal region
	off southern California, year-round, for the next 50 years. The stock
	gradually recovered in the late 1980s and resumed its seasonal migration
	between regions off southern California and Canada. Recently, a model
	was developed which predicts the potential habitat for the northern
	stock of Pacific sardine and its seasonal dynamics. The habitat predictions
	were successfully validated using data from sardine surveys using
	the daily egg production method; scientific trawl surveys off the
	Columbia River mouth; and commercial sardine landings off Oregon,
	Washington, and Vancouver Island. Here, the predictions of the potential
	habitat and seasonal migration of the northern stock of sardine are
	validated using data from "acoustic-trawl" surveys of the entire
	west coast of the United States during the spring and summer of 2008.
	The estimates of sardine biomass and lengths from the two surveys
	are not significantly different between spring and summer, indicating
	that they are representative of the entire stock. The results also
	confirm that the model of potential sardine habitat can be used to
	optimally apply survey effort and thus minimize random and systematic
	sampling error in the biomass estimates. Furthermore, the acoustic-trawl
	survey data are useful to estimate concurrently the distributions

  abstract  = {Sound production by many fish species has been studied extensively,
	but little is known about sound production by rockfishes (genus Sebostes),
	and only a few species have been reported to be soniferous. To determine
	if additional rockfish species produce sounds, passive acoustic recordings
	were made during 2007/08 at Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute and
	Southwest Fisheries Science Center in tanks containing Bocaccio (S.
	poucispinis), Cowcod (S. levis), Starry Rockfish (S. constellatus),
	and Sunset Rockfish (S. crocotulus). Data were collected using pre-amplified
	hydrophones (HTI-94-SSQ) and digitized at sample rates of 44,100
	or 8,000 Hz (using an Edirol R-09 recorder or Edirol UA-5 sound card
	and Ishmael software, respectively). Three distinct sounds were recorded
	in tanks containing only S. paucispinis and two of those sounds occurred
	at different rates during light and dark conditions. Their common
	characteristics were low frequency (below 800 Hz), short duration
	(<4 s), and low source levels (103-113 dB re: 1 mu Pa at 1 m). Also,
	there was evidence one or more other species produced sounds. These
	findings Indicate that more rockfishes produce sounds, and suggest
	passive acoustics could be a useful tool for remotely monitoring
	their populations.},

	in the nearshore waters north of Livingston Island, Antarctica, were
	characterized from six small-boat surveys conducted in late January
	or early February from 2000 to 2007. The first three surveys (2000,
	2002, 2004) were conducted using a 120 kHz split-beam echosounder
	to measure water column acoustic backscatter. The last three surveys
	(2005-2007) were conducted using 38 kHz and 200 kHz singlebeam echosounders.
	A portion of the acoustic backscatter was attributed to Antarctic
	krill based on the results of net tows, underwater video observations,
	and a multiple-frequency acoustic classification algorithm. The annual
	mean krill biomass density in the survey area ranged from 11 to 84
	g.m(-2). Results are compared with the western Scotia Sea area of
	the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program's acoustic
	surveys of krill biomass density for the same years. Near-shore krill
	biomass densities were significantly larger (t test, p < 0.05), more
	stable, and the coefficients of variation were smaller than the much
	larger AMLR surveys. Increased competition between seals, penguins,
	and humans for the nearshore krill resource, especially during the
	austral summer months, could impact the recruitment success of these
	land-based krill predators. Implications of nearshore krill biomass
	on small-scale management units are discussed.},

	nature of interactions between predators and prey at the spatial
	and temporal scales relevant to an individual predator's search behavior.
	Here, we present a new method for examining such interactions using
	the results from an acoustic survey of krill availability to foraging
	penguins. Analyses of fine-scale krill distributions within a 1852
	x 1852 x 50 m volume of ocean revealed substantial prey patchiness
	in all dimensions. Our survey detected the presence of at least 6
	krill aggregations in the survey area. The surface distribution of
	penguins was associated with the edges of these aggregations and
	was nonrandomly associated with krill densities above 0.1 krill m(-3)
	in the 30 to 40 m depth layer. The latter association was masked
	when krill abundance was integrated over the entire water column.
	Given that mean daytime dive depths for chinstrap penguins fall between
	30 and 40 m, our data suggest penguins may fail to detect or choose
	to pass by shallow, denser prey aggregations and successfully forage
	on deeper, more homogeneously distributed krill offering higher encounter
	probabilities per unit volume searched. These findings reveal biologically
	important features of prey patchiness that cannot be addressed within
	the limitations of a primarily 2-dimensional analysis of predator-prey
	distributions. We emphasize that if we hope to gain a predictive
	understanding of the foraging behavior of diving predators, then
	we must consider fine-scale, 3-dimensional patterns of prey patchiness
	when assessing the availability of prey to diving predators.},

  abstract = {Abstract Trawls are standard tools for surveying fisheries resources, yet they are selective in what they retain, and thus provide potentially misleading information about fish populations. In order to evaluate the potential for selective retention in a midwater survey trawl used in conjunction with acoustic surveys of walleye pollock, fish behavior was examined using an integrated approach of optical, acoustic and recapture net methods. A stereo-camera system was used to provide length, position and orientation information, and a dual-frequency identification sonar was used to track fish targets in the trawl. Fish escaping the trawl were sampled using recapture, or pocket, nets mounted to the outside of the trawl. Most fish were found to be oriented along the main trawl axis, facing the forward trawl opening. Nearest distance to the trawl panel did not appear to be length-dependent, however, at night when ambient light levels were lower, fish maintained less distance to the trawl panel compared to daytime observations. Consequently, significantly more fish escapes occurred at lower light levels. Trajectories of fish escaping the trawl were highly variable compared with fish that herded into the net, or those whose retention state was unknown. Greatest escapement into pocket nets was observed from the bottom panel of the trawl at night. These findings suggest that survey trawl samples will be less biased due to selectivity when trawls are conducted during the day.},

The main ex situ results at 38 kHz, including a vertical-excursion experiment, were combined with in situ TS data collected at 38 kHz with a probing, split-beam transducer lowered into the dense herring layers, recorded during two surveys in the wintering area of the Norwegian spring-spawning stock. Multiple-linear regression analysis was used to investigate the functional relationship between TS and the measured parameters. The mean TS of herring was found to be significantly dependent on the depth (pressure) and the gonadosomatic index. These are the additional parameters included in the new TS relationship.},

Measurements of ex situ target strength (TS; dB re 1 m(2)) were made on live anchovy using 38, 120, and 200 kHz split-beam echosounders. The fish were tethered using small hooks attached to their mouths. During the acoustic measurements, an underwater video camera was used to continuously monitor fish behaviour and tilt-angle (theta). Data for 35 individual anchovy ranging from immature to adult sizes (total lengths L(T) = 4.8-12.2 cm) were analysed. Least-squares regression fits of TS vs. log(L(T)) were: TS(38 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 65.8 (r(2) = 0.82), TS(120 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 68.4 (r(2) = 0.84), and TS(200 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 69.1 (r(2) = 0.71). The LT vs. wet weight (W; g) relationship for these fish was W = 0.0036 L(T)(3.204). The mean theta for anchovy swimming freely in a large seawater tank was 9.1 degrees (s.d. = 13.1 degrees). These ex situ measurements of TS, L(T), W, and theta can be applied to improve acoustic estimates of Japanese anchovy biomass.},

  abstract = {Engraulis anchoita is a physostomous fish with a dual chambered swimbladder (sb). In situ target strength (TS) measurements on this species are only possible at night, when anchovies disperse forming a scattering layer near the sea surface. A survey data series comprising more than 50000 single target detections, recorded from 1995 to 2008, was analyzed in order to study the species specific TS at 38 kHz. A TS vs. fish total length (L) equation was obtained from the in situ measurements (TS = 31.9 log L - 82.4 dB; r2= 0.78). When the slope of the regression line was forced to 20 into the TS equation, the resulting value for the constant term (b20) was -68.6 dB. In any case, these results indicate an average difference of +3 dB (higher TS values) when compared with the general model suggested for clupeoid fish. The TS measurements obtained inside the nighttime sound scattering layer exhibited a negative trend with depth. An empirical depth dependence term for the anchovy TS equation was obtained through a three parameter least square fitting of the data [TS = 31.3 log L - 79.6 dB - 4.74 log (1 + z/10); r2 = 0.74]. Anatomical data obtained through high resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography was employed as input for a Prolate Spheroidal Model (PSM). Theoretical TS vs. tilt angle functions were obtained considering the compression of the sb at different depths and under the assumption of different contraction rates. The TS functions were then averaged over different fish tilt angle distributions and used to derive theoretical depth dependence curves of average fish TS. The implications of the adopted sb contraction rate and tilt angle distribution are discussed by comparing the modelled TS(z) curves against the empirical data.},

  abstract = {Pelagic ecosystem dynamics on all temporal scales may be driven by the dynamics of very specialized oceanic habitats. One such habitat is the basin-wide chlorophyll front located at the boundary between the low chlorophyll subtropical gyres and the high chlorophyll subarctic gyres. Global satellite maps of surface chlorophyll clearly show this feature in all oceans. In the North Pacific, the front is over 8000 km long and seasonally migrates north and south about 1000 km. In the winter this front is located at about 30-35 deg N latitude and in the summer at about 40-45 deg N. It is a zone of surface convergence where cool, vertically mixed, high chlorophyll, surface water on the north side sinks beneath warm, stratified, low chlorophyll water on the south side. Satellite telemetry data on movements of loggerhead turtles and detailed fisheries data for albacore tuna show that both apex predators travel along this front as they migrate across the North Pacific. The front is easily monitored with ocean color satellite remote sensing. A change in the position of the TZCF between 1997 and 1998 appears to have altered the spatial distribution of loggerhead turtles. The position and dynamics of the front varied substantially between the 1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o and the 1999 La Ni{\~{n}}a. For example, from May to July 1999 the transition zone chlorophyll front (TZCF) remained between about 35degN and 40degN latitude showing very little meandering, whereas in 1998, during the same period, the TZCF exhibited considerable meandering and greater monthly latitudinal movement. Catch rates for albacore were considerably higher in 1998 than in 1999, and we hypothesize that a meandering TZCF creates regions of convergence, which enhances the foraging habitat for apex predators along the front.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic ocean feature called the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF) was first described fifteen years ago based on an empirical association between the apparent habitat of loggerhead sea turtles and albacore tuna linked to a basin-wide chlorophyll front observed with remotely sensed ocean color data. Subsequent research has provided considerable evidence that the TZCF is an indicator for a dynamic ocean feature with important physical and biological characteristics. New insights into the seasonal dynamics of the TZCF suggest that in the summer it is located at the southern boundary of the subarctic gyre while its position in the winter and spring is defined by the extent of the southward transport of surface nutrients. While the TZCF is defined as the dynamic boundary between low and high surface chlorophyll, it appears to be a boundary between subtropical and subarctic phytoplankton communities. Furthermore, the TZCF is also characterized as supporting enhanced phytoplankton net community production throughout its seasonal migration. Lastly, the TZCF is important to the growth rate of neon flying squid and to the survival of monk seal pups in the northern atolls of the Hawaiian Archipelago. This paper reviews these and other findings that advance our current understanding of the physics and biology of the TZCF from research over the past decade.},

For estimating animal densities along visual transects, the sampled area may be calculated from the products of transect distance and width. In this study, distance was measured relative to submerged pipeline features of known length using: 1) speed estimates from a Doppler velocity log (DVL); and 2) position estimates from an ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic system. DVL estimates of distance were within 0.8 to 1.0% of known feature lengths ranging from 6.01 to 1520.53 m, respectively. USBL estimates of distance were less accurate, ranging from 3.2 to 5.0% over the same distances, and positively biased compared to DVL estimates. Also, transect-width estimates were compared using: 1) calibrated laser metrics; and 2) measurement of camera orientation and optical properties. Both methods produced similar estimates of transect width, and thus area (r2 = 0.81), but width varied with camera altitude and orientation, and increased with seabed relief. Therefore, an assumption of constant transect width may bias estimates of sampled area, and estimates of animal density and abundance, particularly when surveying over seabeds with variable relief. To minimize these biases, practical methods are described to quantify transect distance and width throughout surveys using standard survey equipment and analytical methods.},

The effect of pressure on the relative speeds of sound, (UP-UPH2O)  UO-UOH2O), have been fitted to an equation of the form (with a standard deviation of 0.19 msec-1) (UP-UPH2O)   (UO-UOH2O) =AS (deg/oo)+BS (deg/oo)3/2 +CS (deg/oo)2, where U and UH20 are the speeds of sound in seawater and pure water, respectively; superscripts P and O are used to denote applied pressure P and O (1 atm); A, B, and C are temperature  and pressure dependent parameters; S (o/oo) is the salinity in parts per thousand. This equation has been combined with the refitted high pressure pure water sound speed equation of Wilson [Naval Ordnance Lab. Rep.(1959)], Chen and Millero [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 1270-1273 (1976)], and the 1 atm seawater sound speed data of Millero and Kubinski [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 57, 312-319 (1975)] to calculate the speeds of sound for seawater at various salinities, temperatures, and pressures. Our results agree with the work of Wilson on the average to 0.36 msec-1 over the range of 5 to 40o/oo salinity, 0deg to 30degC, and 0 to 1000 bars. Over the oceanic range our results agree on the average with the work of Wilson to 0.3 msec-1 (maximum deviation 0.6 msec-1), and with the work of Del Grosso to 0.5 msec-1 (maximum deviation 0.9 msec-1). The better agreement of our results with those of Wilson may be fortuitous since our measurements were made relative to his pure water data.},

  abstract  = {Forage fish provide substantial benefits to both humans and ocean food webs, but these benefits may be in conflict unless there are effective policies governing human activities, such as fishing. Collapses of forage fish induce widespread ecological effects on dependent predators, but attributing collapses to fishing has been difficult because of natural fluctuations of these stocks. We implicate fishing in forage fish stock collapses by showing that high fishing rates are maintained when stock productivity is in rapid decline. As a consequence, the magnitude and frequency but not duration of stock collapses are far greater than expected from natural fluctuations. Risk-based management policies would provide substantial ecological benefits with little effect on fishery catches.Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

The suspension apparatus (i.e. net bag or loop of line glued into a hole, and control lines) may appreciably scatter sound, potentially affecting the sphere-echo intensity and phase, and hence the calibration uncertainty. Here, we characterize the effects of conventional suspension materials and configurations on measurements of sphere TS and recommend approaches to mitigate the observed effects on echosounder calibrations. We show that the effects of suspension lines on both calibration accuracy and precision change with line type and increase with line diameter and acoustic frequencies above 100kHz. Compared to commonly used polyamide (nylon) line, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (PE) line has an acoustic impedance closer to that of water and therefore has a lessened effect on measurements of sphere TS. The effects may be mitigated in a practical manner using a 0.38-mm diameter, multifilament, PE line for the suspension.}},
